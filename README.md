# HCI Website Revamp

This is a re-design of the existing [HCI York](https://www.hciyork.co.uk) website, with content served up from a Headless CMS powered by [Strapi](https://strapi.io/).

The Website is written in [Vue](https://www.vuejs.org), building upon the [Nuxt 3](https://www.nuxt.com) meta-framework with a design system powered by [TailwindCSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com).
